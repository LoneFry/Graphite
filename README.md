Graphite
========

Graphite is a Simple MVC web-application framework

Components
----------

- /^/ : Core files, includes base classes for Models, Controllers, a Dispatcher, and a View helper
- /^HTML4/ : HTML4 default site, contains HTML4/JS/CSS for basic functionality
- /^HTML5/ : HTML5 default site, contains HTML5/JS/CSS for basic functionality
- /^CLI/ : A Simple Command Line Interface, other components can expose commands to this

It is possible to build an application on Graphite using only the core files (in path /^/).
The other components are optional, existing as generic implementations of common functionality,
